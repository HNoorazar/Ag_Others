To whom it may conern,

Following your installation guide (https://confluence.esg.wsu.edu/display/KB/Running+Applications#RunningApplications-InstallingCRANpackages) when I try to install

some libraries (“rgdal”) I get errors like:

“----------

configure: error: proj_api.h not found in standard or given locations.

ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘rgdal’

removing ‘/home/hnoorazar/.local/lib/R3.5.1/rgdal’

restoring previous ‘/home/hnoorazar/.local/lib/R3.5.1/rgdal’

The downloaded source packages are in

‘/tmp/RtmpZwU080/downloaded_packages’

Warning message:

In install.packages("rgdal", lib = "~/.local/lib/R3.5.1", repos = "http://mirrors.vcea.wsu.edu/r-cran/") :

  installation of package ‘rgdal’ had non-zero exit status

----------------”

These are the modules I load and use

module load udunits/2.2.20
module load libxml2/2.9.4
module load gdal/2.1.2_gcc proj/4.9.2
module load gcc/7.3.0 r/3.5.1/gcc/7.3.0
module load gcc/7.3.0
module load r/3.5.1/gcc/7.3.0
module load r/3.5.1


P.S. Even thou I am loading R 3.5.3, I kept installing my packaes in “lib="~/.local/lib/R3.5.1"”

I was wondering if you can help me with the issue. AND, if you have

more recent versions of R you can update my script above. Thanks,

Cheers,
