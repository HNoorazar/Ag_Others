\begin{deff}[Variance of a method] Variance refers to the amount by which
$\hat f$ would change if we estimated it using a different training data set.
\end{deff}
\pause
\begin{deff}[Bias of a method] Bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model.
